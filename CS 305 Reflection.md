Software Security

For this class, I created a secure software report for a fake client, Artemis Financial. In the scenario, Artemis Financial needed an updated web client interface to handle uploading their files to long term storage. The first and most important security update that I added to their existing web platform was to add a CA and route the site through HTTPS. This is an important first step for their clients and users, as it shows the users that they are indeed using a secure authenticated connection. In the case of Artemis financial, we used self signed certificates, because we assumed they would be using an internal intranet to upload the files to their storage system, but in the case where they were using a third party storage site or we would allows users that did not belong to the company to upload files, we may want to have acquired externally generated CA’s. In all cases, having a secure web connection and using secure coding practices helps mitigate against malicious actors abusing our software to harm our business or our clients. 

This exercise really helped put the practical applications of software security practices into perspective for me. I have a pretty general notion of the most common types of software attacks and vulnerabilities, but having some first hand experience building the first layer of defenses for a web API was really a great experience. It was also really great seeing some of the tools available, like the Maven dependency check plugin. I used this plugin to identify known security risks in the dependencies used to launch the web application, and helped me get some practice mitigating against those vulnerabilities. In future, I would really like to get some more practical knowledge of different web API’s like .NET and Spring.

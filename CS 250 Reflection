CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle

This class was focused mostly on examining a generic Software Development Lifecycle through the lense of Agile-Scrum. We examined the typical Scrum team and their individual roles, and spent time practicing each role in the Scrum team in a mock Agile sprint. We also did a little Java programming, learning to export programs to executable Jar files. 

The final project for this class was a sprint review and retrospective, in which we reported on the work we did in each role during the mock sprint. We talked about how we developed work items from user stories, and what techniques we used to help ensure that our list of client requirements was complete and comprehensive. We also reviewed how each memeber of the Scrum team contributes to the sprint, and how the different memebers of the team need to work together to efficiently meet client expectations and deadlines. 

Overall this class was a good peak into what its like to be in an actual development team. We did a lot of collaborating about what we thought the best development methodologies were for diffferent kinds of projects and teams, and discussed the pros and cons of waterfall versus agile quite a bit.

CS 330 - Compuational Graphics and Visualization

This course was focused on using OpenGL to create a 3D scene based on an image. We used OpenGL C++ libraries, and designed a somewhat modular program that could be used to render numerous simple and complex objects.

My typical approach to designing software starts with trying to understand the final project, and determining how each functional section of the program should be designed. I think that process works well in general and would have worked well in this project if I had a better understanding of OpenGL when I was designing the software. About halfway through the course, I spent a pretty significant amount of time redesigning my project, and knowing what I know now I would probably redesign it again if I had the time before the end of term. So I suppose my biggest general takeaway from this project was how important it is to understand the tools you’re using before you design the final project. Were I to re-do this project, or in future when learning new tools, I think I’ll spent a lot more time designing discrete, functional sections of the program to make sure I understand the tool as a whole before I tackle a larger project. 

Learning about computational graphics and visualizations was a very interesting process for me. I had an okay understanding of how CPU’s process information before this term, but the way a GPU buffers and busses data around was somewhat of a mystery. Another great experience in this course was getting to use some trigonometry and linear algebra to write algorithms that modularized the creation of vertex data. I was able to use some basic trig to define vertices and indices for circles, spheres and cylinders, and used linear algebra to manipulate matrices that defined the position, location and scale of my objects and lighting. 

Overall, this course was really great experience. I got to learn new hardware and software principles, and put a bunch of development principles and skills into practice.

CS 370 - Current/Emerging Trends in CS

For this course, our final project was to configure an intelligent agent that would devise a strategy to solve a simple maze. The code I developed for this project was essentially the configuration for the algorithms. I defined the parameters, the rewards and the Q-value calculations for the agent, then tested it in an attempt to find the most effective parameters for training the algorithm.

In the larger picture, a computer scientist is a person who studies computer fundamentals and applies them to provide tools for other computer scientists or end users to leverage computing power to their advantage. In the modern day, computer science touches every other feild of human development. Without the advances in computer science made in the last 50 years, essentially all other fields of scientific reserach and practical human industry would not be nearly as efficient. 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. I break them down into their component pieces, solve each piece as efficiently as possible, and then connect the pieces into a coherant solution. Along the way, it's my responsibility to ensure that my software is functional, modular, and minimizes any potential risks to the end user. That last responsibility is a difficult balancing act, especially when considering the material covered by this course; intelligent algorithms. When considering security risks mitigation can be relatively simple, using industry best practices and adding failsafes that can alert the users about potential security risks is usually enough for most software. But when attempting to ensure your software isn't used for nefarious purposes, things get a bit more complicated. Intelligent algorithms are becoming more and more sophisticated, with more general use applications. This means that as computer scientists, we need to do what we can to at least ensure that our users are informed about what exactly the software they're using does and how it might be exploited.

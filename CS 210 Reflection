CS 210 - Programming Languages

This course was focused on teaching us some common best practices in coding and how to navigate peripheral coding practices like commenting, file structuring, naming conventions, etc. This was my first course using C++, and by the end of the course we were integrating python classes into C++ programs. This class gave me some more practice in using OOP to develop programs with discrete and functional objects, and was a really great experience in learning some of the lower level processes that have to happen when you call complex methods in Python and Java. 

Our final project for this course was more practice in integrating Python and C++. We developed an application that accepts a txt file input with a list of items sold in a grocery store. The program, in C++ prints a menu that asks the user whether they would like a full account of the items sold, a count of a specific item, or a file containing a histogram of the items sold. The code processes the files and outputs them in Python. I'm pretty proud of the integration, and the effiency of my python code.

After this class I really took to C++, starting several personal projects that were written in the language. I also started from here trying to learn from and use resources provided by a Youtube developer, Javidx9 to hone my skills with C++ and learn more efficient syntax and methods in the language.

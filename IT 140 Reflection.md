Into to Scripting

This class we focused on the very basic principles of OOP. We learned about the basics of defining objects and scope, using loops and methods, and a small bit of defining classes. We did this using the Python programming language using the PyCharm IDE. All our work from the course was put together in a final project, where we created a very short and simple text based adventure. 


I had a really good experience developing the text based adventure. Before this class I had a somewhat nebulous grasp on OOP and general software development principles, and this class and project did a really great job of giving me a good, solid starting point. We had some good practice in making flowcharts and pseudocode, using several different data types in Python, and got some good experience in program flow. 

The text based adventure I wrote is very simple, having only a handfull of rooms and only two commands you can access; go and get. You can tell the character to go any of the four cardinal directions, and if they can move that way they will. You can also get an item in the rooms, and the room description is updated to disclude the item when you have it. The game ends when you enter the room with the villain, and if you've found all the items, you assemble the weapon and win the game, and if you haven't the villain gets you and you lose. The program was very simple, but it was excpetionally good practice.

CS 230 - Operating Platforms

The Gaming Room was a client that requested that we make their web based game with a client-server programming patttern. They also requested that their game be available on MAC, IOS, Android and Windows. While designing their program, considering the client's requirements and attempting to optimize their existing programming plan were my main focus. 

Developing the design document helped the team anticipate potential problems with the project as it existed so far, and what needed to be done to meet the client's expectations. I think looking back at the document, I may add a few more cautionary statements about the level of expertise required to operate the program in linux. I think I didn't understand how much extra work is required to optimize Linux for this project, and I think the overall quality of the document would be improved if that was a little more lcear to the client. 

A large part of the design document was dedicated to addressing the client's request for the program to be accessible on any operating system. We had to consider how we would separate the client side code so it could interact with the server code regardless of the operating system. The design document is intended to make clear tot he client how the team will be tailoring our development cycle to their needs. Obviously, if a program doesn't meet client specifications, then the development team failed. therefore it's very important to ensure that the design document makes clear to the team and the client how we will be addressing their needs.

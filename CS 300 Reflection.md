CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design 

This was one of my favorite courses so far at SNHU. The final project for this course was to create a program in C++ that could read course information from a jagged
data structure stored in a CSV, store it in one of the data structures we learned about in the course, and use the associated algorithms to print the course information
in alphanumeric order. We also needed the app to let the user ask for course information about a specific course. 

In the end, I decided to use a binary search tree for this app, since it was the easiest on memeory, allowed for easy alphanumeric printing and had adequate access
time for the project. My biggest struggle during this course was taking the partially completed code provided each week and determining exactly what needed to be finished
in order for the app to function. During the project, I created a basic TODO list based on the pseudocode skeleton I wrote for the project. This approach worked really 
well for me, and was a good test of my usual development process. I think going forward, I'll likely continue to use this process, adding in additional resources like
psuedocode and flowcharts for more complex projects. 

Another couple big opportunites I got during this course was to get some real experience with Visual Studio's tools, and with effective commenting. For the most part, I
could eek by not knowing all that much about Visual Studio, but this course really gave me the chance to explore the tools it offers and get comfortable using it as a 
development environment. In the weekly assignments, I also got some really good examples of effective commenting, and in completing the project I got a chance to 
practice commenting for myself. 

Lastly, I think this course was really good practice in creating code that is maintainable and reusable. Most of the second project's algorithms were copied or adapted
from the previous week's assignement on binary search trees. This saved me a lot of time, which I was able to put into making the program more efficient and user friendly

This portfolio is a collection of assignemnets and reflections from my time at Southern New Hampshire University in the Computer Science program. Each file is named for the course it is associated with and each reflection file has the full course name included at the top. 

KEY:

- CS 210 - Programming Languages
- CS 230 - Operating Platforms
- CS 250 - Software Development Lifecycle
- CS 255 - System Analysis and Design
- CS 300 - Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design
- CS 305 - Software Security
- CS 320 - Software Testing, Automation and Quality Assurance
- CS 330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization
- CS 340 - Client/Server Development
- CS 350 - Emerging System Architecture and Technology
- CS 360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming
- CS 370 - Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science
- CS 410 - Software Reverse Engineering
- CS 465 - Full Stack Development I
- IT 140 - Intro to Scripting
- IT 145 - Foundation in Application Development

NOTE: This portfolio is not a comprehensive list of courses or projects I completed at SNHU, merely the courses and related projects I felt were relevant to my development as a programmer and merited extended reflection. 

Additional relevant courses that I did not write reflections for are included below.
- MAT 350 - Applied Linear Algebra - Used Matlab to apply linear algebra principles to networking and image compression
- CS 319 - UI/UX Design and Development - Explored different user interface principles, and practiced implementing user feedback into design iterations.

//TODO: Include a program reflection when I graduate

CS 255 - System Anaylsis and Design

For this class, our final project was to design a system for a client called DriverPass. The client was a corporation who wanted to set up a system whereby customers
could purchase additional resources to help them pass their driver's test. These resources came in the form of readables and interactables, as well as the ability to
schedule driving appointments with instructors. 

I'm proud of the work I did for this project in the recommnedations and systems analysis. I believe I was thorough and thoughtful in outlining how the system would work
and what the best resources and tools for the project would be. Looking back, I really wish I had more skill in charting. I tried my best to create accurate and readable
charts for the projects, but I lack the aptitude for that kind of thing. If I could try again, I would probably spend more time practing that skill.

We started this project by collecting the user needs in a scripted interview. From there we were able to determine what infrastructure would be required to support their
design, and how the overall system could work. A big part of this class was highlighting how to take a small list of user needs and expand them into an entire system, so
I spent a good amount of time considering what the client had outlined for us. 

When it comes to developing software, I have a tendency to write a to do list and get started coding right away. I update my todo list as I identify pieces of the project
will need to be completed to support what I am working on. This class gave me the tools I need to tackle bigger projects, by outlining how a system can be broken down
into it's functional parts and developed according to OOP principles. I think the tool I see myself using most from this class is UML class diagrams for a system. This
diagram outlines all the required objects for a system to function, and I think will be a really helpful tool for me while developing larger projects.

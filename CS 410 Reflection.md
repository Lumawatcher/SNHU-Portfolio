CS 410 â€“ Software Reverse Engineering
REFLECTION

This course was focused on using tools like GDB and G++ to disassemble object files and reverse engineer the source code from the resulting assembly code. We then proceeded to identify basic security risks and recommend solutions to those problems. 

Learning assembly taught me a lot about how a CPU processes code, and even more about how compilers translate code into machine code. We also talked a lot about the ethics and legal situation surrounding software reverse engineering. This level of engineering really interests me, and I would love to learn more about machine code and how other programming language compilers work.

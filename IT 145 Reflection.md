IT 145 - Foundation in Application Development

In many ways this course was a continuation of IT 140, which I completed the previous term. This course was focuesed on using the Java programming language and the Eclipse IDE to develop classes for a larger project using OOP. Most assignments for this course were practice in assigning scope to objects and learning to instantiate multiple instances of an objet as needed. We also covered inheritance and abstraction, but only in a very simple way. 

The final project for this course was a collection of Java classes that could be used in a system for animals that would be adopted and used in search and rescue operations across the globe. The goal of this project from a learning perspective was to teach us how to keep a central list of class objects, and how we can use abstraction and inheritance to simplify the creation of more specific class objects. We did this by creating a "RescueAnimal" class that was abstract, and inheriting it for each of the two kinds of rescue animals, dogs and monkeys. Then, we created a looping menu that would allow the user to intake or check on the status of current rescue animals. 

OOP is kind of the backbone of modern (or at least more recent) software development practices, so having this course was really helpful in setting the stage for my later learning. I learned a lot of new things about classes and OOP, and helped clear up a bunch of misunderstandings I had from trying to learn C# on my own before I enrolled at SNHU. All the while, I also got a lot of exposure to Java and Eclipse which was also very helpful in some of my later courses.
